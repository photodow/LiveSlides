<h2>Website Proposal</h2>
<h3>LiveSlides Conception</h3>
<p>The other day I attended a lectureship at my alma mater, and they had a speaker who used a keynote presentation. In
an audience of somewhere over a thousand people, I was seated near the back row directly to the right of the speaker.
The keynote presentation was barely visible, only a sliver of the screen could be seen because of my angle. If only I
had been sitting ten rows closer, and not behind a Goliath, I might have been able to see the forty inch plasma TV set
up at the front of the auditorium for people in my situation. I had an iPad sitting in my lap and thought it would have
been great if I could have somehow had the presenter’s presentation in my lap.</p>
<p>This, essentially, is what I want to create: a way for any audience member to view keynote presentations from their
own device as they are being presented in real-time.</p>
<h3>What is LiveSlides?</h3>
<p>LiveSlides is a web based application that can be run from any desktop or mobile device’s browser. The presenter will
set up his/her professional presentation via our presentation editor. Once the presenter hits save, he/she will be given
a link to share with their audience. The audience members will copy and paste the URL into their web browser and they will automatically be synced with the presenter’s view. When the presenter goes to the next slide the audience’s
screens will change in realtime.</p>
<p>In future development I would like to add audio, and video capabilities, so people on the other side of the world will be able to listen/watch the presentation live. I think it would also be beneficial to be able to record the live presentation for playback at a later date.</p>
<h3>Why should you invest in LiveSlides?</h3>
<p>You should invest in my idea because it is one of a kind. Compared to solutions like GoToWebinar, and Join.me, it is
light-weight with no software required to install on either user’s end because it is completely written in HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. Just give your audience a live presentation link and you will be good to go. The presenter controls the
slides, and the audience members just watch and listen. These presentations are also SEO friendly and easy to copy
and paste into any website.</p>
<p>Did I mention it’s free? We’ll draw the user in with a free version of the website and get them hooked wanting more
from their live HTML presentations. While they are getting familiar with the free version we will start to build the
paid version, which includes audio/video and recorded playback. The paid service is where you’ll see your return on
investment.</p>
<p>I can see it now... Universities and conferences all over the world will be using this product for their professional
presentations! Who knows, maybe even the next Steve Jobs will decide to use LiveSlides.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Here is a list of technology I plan to be using throughout this project to help meet our deadline with a fully functional web application. This list may adjust as needs progress throughout the project.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<h3>Diane Gordon</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Age:</strong> 65</li>
  <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Radio Host</li>
  <li><strong>Salary:</strong> $1,000,000</li>
  <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Firefox</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong><br />
Diane hosts a radio show to give financial advice to
anyone who will listen. LiveSlides would be helpful to
those who listen to Diane’s show because she could
easily set up her slides for listeners to view as she
speaks live on the radio. When we implement the
voiceover and video into the web application, Diane
would be able to use the paid version on her website
so people could view the presentation after the fact,
similar to the videos she currently has except it would
be more visually appealing and easier to follow along.</p>

<h3>Troy Schwartz</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Age:</strong> 54</li>
  <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Photographer</li>
  <li><strong>Salary:</strong> $60,000</li>
  <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Safari</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong><br />
Troy hosts seminars and workshops for photographers
and designers like himself so he can help others
excel. Naturally, LiveSlides would be a useful tool
for his tech-savvy audience members to use while
participating in his workshops. Once the paid version
has been implemented, people who are unable to
attend his seminars in person would be able to join
in too.</p>

<h3>Alex Cook</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Age:</strong> 25</li>
  <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Gospel Preacher</li>
  <li><strong>Salary:</strong> $40,000</li>
  <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Chrome</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong><br />
Alex seeks to serve his local congregation by helping
them better understand the Bible. He sometimes
uses visual aids such as whiteboards/chalkboards,
but would like to transition to a more modern
type of visual aid, such as a powerpoint or keynote
presentation. Since the lighting in the auditorium is
not ideal for a projector, some of the more elderly
members have a difficult time viewing the slides on
the screen. LiveSlides would be an ideal solution for
teachers like Alex.</p>

<h3>Tricia Reed</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Age:</strong> 85<li>
  <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Retired</li>
  <li><strong>Salary:</strong> n/a</li>
  <li><strong>Technology:</strong> IE9</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong><br />
As a member of the Church, Raymond listens to
sermons on a regular basis as an audience member
in order to continue to learn and grow as a Christian.
LiveSlides would be a useful tool for Tricia, as an older
audience member with dimming eyesight, because it
would help her better view any slide presentations
from her mobile device.</p>
