    	<h3>About</h3>
        <p>Diane hosts a radio show to give financial advice to anyone who will listen. Videos are also posted on her website so people can watch her recording her show and view various captions while listening. LiveSlides would be helpful to those who listen to Dianeâ€™s show because she could easily set up her slides for listeners to view as she speaks live on the radio. When we implement the voiceover and video into the web application, Diane would be able to use the paid version on her website so people could view the presentation after the fact, similar to the videos she currently has except it would be more visually appealing and easier to follow along.</p>
