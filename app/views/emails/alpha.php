    	<h2 style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Status Update</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;font-size:14px;color: #515151;text-align: justify;">I just wanted to give you all a quick status update on the LiveSlides project. Tomorrow marks the release date for our Alpha stage. What this means is that we are well on our way to producing a great application for our users to use. At the moment there are only a few features that are fully functional, and a lot more features that need some touching up to do. </p>
    	<h2 style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Things To Look Out For</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;font-size:14px;color: #515151;text-align: justify;">Expect to be able to see the HTML/CSS layouts of just about every page, and the ability to take action on the visible forms. You should be able to effectively contact me from within the LiveSlides UI now. More importantly we have registration, and authentication up live now. So please get in there and get your hands dirty with what few features we have fully functional, and provide me with your feedback.</p>
    	<h2 style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Feedback</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;font-size:14px;color: #515151;text-align: justify;">You can leave me your feedback from within the LiveSlides UI by using the Contact Form on the home page. Just click 'Contact Us' in the navigation and it should take you right there.</p>
    	<h2 style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 5px;">The Next Two Weeks</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;font-size:14px;color: #515151;text-align: justify;">The next two weeks we are going to be diving hard into the development phase. Next week we are releasing Alpha where we should be able to see the User Profiles and even some of the LiveSlides Presentations come to life. So keep your eye out for those features.</p>
