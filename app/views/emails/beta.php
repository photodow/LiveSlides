    	<h1 style="font-size: 24px;margin-bottom: 40px;">Beta Release Announcement!</h1>
    	<h2 style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Status Update</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;font-size:14px;color: #515151;text-align: justify;">This week we are launching Beta. It's not exactly where I wish it was, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to test this week. I think this is great! Releasing small sets of features every week gives us the opportunity to test every feature, and helps prevent some of the small annoying bugs getting through to production.</p>
    	<h2 style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Things To Look For</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;font-size:14px;color: #515151;text-align: justify;">I want you to look at this website this week in terms of user experience. How easy was the registration process? Were you able to login? Esspecially take a look at the menu, and let me know your thoughts on the UI. The user profile is pulling from the database, but you can't edit the information yet. I have some basic UI functionality on how you'll be editing your profile though. Take a look at what I have (headline, about) and let me know if the editing process is user friendly enough, or if we need to go to a more traditional manner of editing user profile information.</p>
    	<h2 style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Next Week</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;font-size:14px;color: #515151;text-align: justify;">Next week we are scheduled to push to production, but the way I understand it spring break has pushed our launch date back a week for May 1st. That's great! It gives us a little more time to focus on bugs, and building a quality web application. This next week the plan is to get our LiveSlides up and running for the most part. I will not be surprised if all features will make it into the first phase of production, but we're going to focus on the important ones for right now. Aside from that the idea is to get the user profile up and running too, and of course bugs bugs bugs! I'm taking the tomorrow off to rest, but after that we are going to get down and dirty with this web application, get ready!</p>
    	<h2 style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Feedback</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;font-size:14px;color: #515151;text-align: justify;">You can leave me your feedback from within the LiveSlides UI by using the Contact Form on the home page. Just click 'Contact Us' in the navigation and it should take you right there.</p>
